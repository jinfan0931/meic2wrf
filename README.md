# Additional function:
* A no-GUI script for command line user
* Add `ll_area_new` for more accurent meic grid area(using [geojson-area](https://github.com/scisco/area)) and `meic2wrf_interp` for linear interpolation instead of nearest interpolation, especially for wrf with a high spatial resolution
